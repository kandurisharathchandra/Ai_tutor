    "what is underfitting",
    "Answer:\nUnderfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simplistic to adequately capture the underlying patterns within the training data. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n*   **Step 1: Model Simplification:** A learning algorithm attempts to approximate a \"target function\" to make predictions. In underfitting, the chosen model or the target function it approximates is kept excessively simple.\n*   **Step 2: Inability to Capture Nuances:** Due to its simplicity, the model cannot capture the \"essential nuances\" or the true, complex relationships present in the data. It fails to \"represent the underlying data well.\"\n*   **Step 3: Poor Training Performance:** As a direct consequence, the model performs poorly even on the data it was trained on. It doesn't learn the fundamental relationships adequately, leading to a high error rate on the training set.\n*   **Step 4: Insufficient Data Capture:** The model is not capable of capturing the data \"good enough.\" For instance, as mentioned in the context, \"lower degree models\" (like a simple straight line, e.g., degree 1) might be too basic to fit complex data, leading to underfitting.\n*   **Step 5: Generalization Issues (Often):** While underfitting primarily manifests as poor performance on training data, it also means the model is unlikely to generalize well to unseen (test) data because it hasn't learned the core patterns correctly in the first place."
