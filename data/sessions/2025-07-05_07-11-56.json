    "what is random forest",
    "Answer:\n*   **Ensemble Method:** Random Forest is a powerful classifier that aggregates the versatility of numerous individual decision tree models into a single, more robust model.\n*   **Implementation:** It is typically implemented using the `RandomForestClassifier` library, found within `sklearn.ensemble`.\n*   **Problem Versatility:** The algorithm is applicable for solving both classification and regression problems.\n*   **Feature Importance Assessment:** It provides estimates (or assessments) identifying the most important features contributing to the overall classification.\n*   **Internal Generalization Error Estimation:** As the forest is generated, it produces an internal, unbiased estimate of its generalization error.\n*   **Model Persistence:** Trained Random Forest models can be saved for future deployment and application on new datasets.\n*   **Computational Cost:** It is computationally more expensive compared to a simpler model like a single decision tree.\n*   **Interpretability:** Due to its combination of multiple decision trees, it is not as straightforward to understand or interpret as a single decision tree model.\n*   **Performance Evaluation:** Model accuracy (e.g., 0.84375) and the confusion matrix are used to review its performance."
