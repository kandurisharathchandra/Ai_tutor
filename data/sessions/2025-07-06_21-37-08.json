    "what is linear regression",
    "Answer:\nLinear regression is a foundational concept in supervised learning, understood through the following steps:\n\n*   **Step 1: Classification as a Regression Problem:** Linear regression falls under the category of \"regression problems\" within supervised learning.\n*   **Step 2: Objective of Prediction:** Its primary goal is to predict a \"real-value variable\" (e.g., 'Price', 'Weight').\n*   **Step 3: Nature of Output:** The results forecasted by a linear regression model are always a \"continuous output,\" meaning the predicted value can be any number within a given range.\n*   **Step 4: Identification of Variables:**\n    *   **Dependent Variable (Y):** This is the specific value that the model aims to predict.\n    *   **Independent Variable (X):** Also referred to as the \"predictor,\" this variable is utilized by the regression model to estimate the value of the Dependent Variable (Y).\n*   **Step 5: Establishing Functional Relationship:** The core premise is that the Dependent Variable (Y) is presumed to be functionally related to, and therefore depends on, the Independent Variable(s) (X). The model seeks to quantify this relationship.\n*   **Step 6: Modeling the Linear Relationship:** In its essence, linear regression models this functional relationship as a straight line. This line is defined by its \"slope\" (which indicates the rate of change of Y with respect to X) and its \"intercept\" (the value of Y when X is zero).\n*   **Step 7: Types of Linear Regression:** Depending on the number of independent variables used, linear regression can be:\n    *   **Simple Linear Regression:** Involves only one independent variable (X) to predict Y.\n    *   **Multiple Linear Regression:** Involves two or more independent variables (X) to predict Y."
