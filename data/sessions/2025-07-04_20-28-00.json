    "what is regression",
    "Answer:\n\n* **Supervised Learning Task:** Regression is a supervised learning task where we predict a *continuous* output variable.  This contrasts with classification, where the output is categorical.\n\n* **Predicting Real Values:**  It aims to forecast real-valued quantities like 'Price', 'Weight', or other measurable attributes.  Think of predicting house prices based on size, location, etc.\n\n* **Dependent and Independent Variables:** Regression models a relationship between a dependent variable (Y - the value being predicted) and one or more independent variables (X - the predictors).  The dependent variable is assumed to be a function of the independent variables.  Symbolically:  Y = *f*(X).\n\n* **Example:** In the provided context, predicting house prices (Y) based on the number of rooms (X) or multiple features like number of rooms, location, and age of the house (multidimensional regression) are examples of regression problems.  The `boston.data` likely represents the independent variables (X), and `boston.target` represents the dependent variable (Y - house prices).\n\n* **Coefficient of Determination (R\u00b2):**  The R\u00b2 score is a metric used to evaluate the performance of a regression model. It measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).  R\u00b2 ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit.  While related to the correlation coefficient (R) in simple linear regression, R\u00b2 is more general and applicable to multidimensional regression."
